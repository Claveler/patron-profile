Default (default)

The default button is the standard style of a button that is typically used for most buttons in our user interface. It is usually designed to provide a clear indication of clickable elements, such as CTA or form submission buttons.

Sharp

The Sharp variant, also known as black and white buttons, is a different style of button that can be used for a variety of reasons, such as:

To provide a more minimalistic or understated design for the UI.
To create a high-contrast design for users with visual impairments.
To differentiate a specific type of button from others in the UI.




Danger

The danger button is designed to highlight critical actions or potential risks in our interface. It stands out to ensure users exercise caution, preventing accidental clicks and promoting a safer experience.
