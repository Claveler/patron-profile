The grid system

The grid system is integral to our design approach. All measurements align to a base unit of an 8-based grid for mobile, tablet, and desktop, while smaller elements like icons and type align to a 4-unit grid.

This approach helps us maintain consistency and facilitates communication between designers and developers. We chose an 8-unit grid as most screen sizes are divisible by 4, and 4 is itself an easily divisible number.

The spacing system

Our spacing system is based on our grid system, promoting a visually balanced user interface through consistent spacing. This enhances the quality of the UI and helps to create hierarchy and relationships between elements.

Don't be afraid of empty space!

We employ two types of spacing: horizontal and vertical. The horizontal spacing is primarily guided by the grid system and spacing between elements, while the vertical spacing follows set rules and minimum spacings between components. Every component in our design follows these grids. Effective use of spacing contributes to efficient layouts.
